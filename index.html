<p>MANHATTAN, N.Y. -- People gathered at Foley Square on Wednesday to support Ramsey Orta, the man who recorded Eric Garner’s death, and to celebrate his birthday. </p>

<p>Orta, now 28, recorded the video in 2014 and shared it with the Daily News days after the incident. His friends and family claim that NYPD has targeted him and his family since. Currently, he is in prison on charges of sale of a controlled substance and possession of a weapon according to the Department of Corrections.

<div class="p1"
<p> The rally, aimed at supporting Orta, was co-organized by Jewel Miller. Miller is the mother of Garner’s youngest daughter, Legacy. According to Miller, Garner knew Orta for three years before his death and the two were close friends. </p>

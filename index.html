<div class="p1">
<p>MANHATTAN, N.Y. -- People gathered at Foley Square on Wednesday to support Ramsey Orta, the man who recorded Eric Garner’s death, and to celebrate his birthday. </p>
</div>
<div> 
    </div>
 <div class="p1">
<p>Orta, now 28, recorded the video in 2014 and shared it with the Daily News days after the incident. His friends and family claim that NYPD has targeted him and his family since. Currently, he is in prison on charges of sale of a controlled substance and possession of a weapon according to the Department of Corrections.
</p>
</div> 
<div class="p1"
<p> The rally, aimed at supporting Orta, was co-organized by Jewel Miller. Miller is the mother of Garner’s youngest daughter, Legacy. According to Miller, Garner knew Orta for three years before his death and the two were close friends. </p>

                <blockquote>
                  <b> <span style="color:#60463B">
                             “Ramsey was the reason we know about Eric." </span> </b>
                   </blockquote>

  <div>
    </div>
    <div class="p1">
      <p> "I used to see him with his daughter. After school, kids would go to the bodega across from Tompkinsville Park. Ramsey was there. He’d buy the kids lollipops," Miller said.
    <div>
      </div>
<div> <p> Miller added that the rally was to show Orta that he has support outside of prison. “He’s a political prisoner. Saying his name is saying Eric’s name,” Miller said. </p> </div>
<div>
</div>
Deja Richardson, Orta’s partner, spoke to the crowd of supporters. She said Orta had just spent a month in solitary confinement and will not eat prison food because he fears being poisoned. </p>

  <p> The group sang happy birthday to Orta, who turned 28. Pictured in front are Deja Richardson, Jewel Miller and two other activists. </p> </div>

<div class="p1">
  <p>“He lost his parole hearing,” Richardson said emotionally. “He’s getting out July 2020. Thank you. We appreciate you.”
  <div>
  </div>

Tyquandra Mckenney, Miller’s partner, then performed a piece called “Killer Cops,” which references people of color killed by police officers. 
<div>
  </div>
“These killer cops, I can’t breathe with your arms on my neck,” she chanted. The crowd yelled “stop” back each time this line was said.</p>
<div>
  </div>
  <div class="p1">
    <p> 
While Mckenney addressed the crowd, she said that Daniel Pantaleo, the Staten Island police officer who placed Garner in a chokehold, needed to be in jail. Pantaleo was fired from the NYPD earlier this year due to his actions with Garner. Many fear he could move out of state, get a new job and kill someone else.

<p> Sista Shirley, an activist from Staten Island, spoke to the crowd of Orta supporters while holding a sign depicting victims of police brutality. </p> </div>
  <div class="p1">
    <p> The Resistance Company, an activist rock band, was also present at the rally. One of the band members named Mark said that we all have to be 100 percent active and vigilant to prevent further incidents like this. </p>
    <div>
    </div>
    <div class="p1">
      <p> “We are all human beings. Unfortunately, the general theme of capitalist America is protecting the one percent. That’s why they murdered Eric,” Mark said. “It’s our responsibility to explain to those who run the system that it's our world.”
